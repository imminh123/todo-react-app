# Todo App In React

### As I only had about 3 hours for making this app so I'm very aware of the "not so responsive" of the app and input verification but I'm surely very capable of doing this if I have more time. Otherwise all the functions is complete. Thanks for checking out my little project.

### `yarn start`
  
Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
